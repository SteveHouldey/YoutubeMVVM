# YoutubeMVVM

So its been a long time comming, this program is basically me showcasing what I have learnt when it comes to MVVM, and more so how useful the MVVM Community toolkit actually is.

I plan on creating a Youtube Video and associated branches so you can follow along with the code.

The Master Branch will be updated to the latest version of the project, but you can download / pull the required branch if you wish to follow along and make your own modifications.

Please check back to see what I have planned to explain and showcase.
